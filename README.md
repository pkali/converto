# converto
A front-end–only mobile web app that converts between different units (e.g., Fahrenheit/Celsius, Miles/Kilometers) using an intuitive “sliding” or “momentum scrolling” interface.

It is a Progressive Mobile App, so you can install it on you mobile device desktop and use offline.

I made it because the apps available in stores suck. This one sucks as well, but does not have ads :)
